            <h4>Privacy is Dead. Deal With It</h4>
			<h5>[Editorial]</h5>
			<p style=" text-indent: 3em;">This page be an editorial piece based on the article written by Jacob Morgan titled <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2014/08/19/privacy-is-completely-and-utterly-dead-and-we-killed-it/" target="_blank">Privacy Is Completely And Utterly Dead, And We Killed It</a></p>
			
			<hr>
			<p style=" text-indent: 3em;">To start off, I agree with Jacob Morgan’s sentiments almost entirely. He declares that the current state of privacy is dead due to the massive amount of terms and conditions we accept when we visit and use large corporation’s websites. The fact that we rely so heavily on the internet is a major reason why we lack internet privacy. Shopping, social media, and using applications all contribute to this. </p>
			<p style=" text-indent: 3em;">Morgan is correct in that we give up our privacy willingly. Terms and conditions are usually pages long and the quick thing to do is just to hit accept and move on. Companies like Facebook and Google are not out to get us are they so why worry or just pure laziness, are the typical sentiments when we start reading policies. However, Facebook constantly faces criticism for their lack of privacy as in the case where they were accused of being vulnerable to data mining. Data mining is when third parties can run automated scripts to collect information through Facebook. All this is legal due to what settings you share on default in your Facebook.</p>
			<p style=" text-indent: 3em;">Morgan’s statements on the government are a bit inaccurate. I do believe that the government is not doing its best to protect us and also there is a lack of “desire to educate the masses on these issues”. However every time legislations are pushed through congress to regulate the internet, tech corporations all unite together to denounce these regulations. Stating they are fighting for a free and open internet. These companies have large followings which lead to demonstrations and protest and acts are rarely passed. But without some regulations corporations are free to do as they please. </p>
			<p style=" text-indent: 3em;">To finish off his article, Morgan provides two options. One is to stay ignorant and accept that privacy is dead. The other is to “challenge this notion and continue to fight for privacy”. He hopes that corporations can be more open and transparent. Also he wants to be able to use technologies without seeing all our personal information and buy and use products without worry. I would like to add on to what he has already discussed and that is for people to get educated. This site was created as a stepping stone for people to be more aware of the issues with regards to internet privacy. As people continue to become more educated we will see that Google and Facebook are not these white knight companies as we perceive them to be.</p>
		
			<p><i>tl;dr: Privacy is considered dead, unless we get more educated on this issue and fight for our privacy.</i></p>
